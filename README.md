# Python-Pandas-Stadmodels-Webscraping

In the first part of the Jupyther notebook you can find some examples of Data Processing using Numpy and Pandas. 
The second part is focused in creating Machine Learning models using "stadmodels".  The third part shows the development of a program
to set a password and store it in a pickle file. Finally, the last exercise shows a Webscraping application using selenium. 
There, a program queries all people on the English-language Wikipedia who are born on a specific day. The results are stored in a JSON file.
